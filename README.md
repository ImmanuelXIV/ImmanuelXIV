### Hey, I'm Immanuel! 👋🏽‍

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer from Germany 🇩🇪 who loves building AI products! I mostly code in JavaScript, Python and C++ 💻 and I'm currently diving into web3! I worked at some cool startups (e.g., Freeletics 🏃🏽‍), did some Computer Vision and Deep Learning projects, and co-founded a health tech startup in London! 🌱

Reach out to me 📫 if you are interested in web3, Machine Learning, Open Source, and building AI products that make the world a better place!
