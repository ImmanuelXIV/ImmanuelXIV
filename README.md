### Hey, I'm Immanuel! 👋🏽‍

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer from Germany 🇩🇪 who loves building AI products! I mostly code in JavaScript, Python and C++ 💻 and I'm currently diving into Reinforcement Learning! I worked at some cool startups (e.g., Freeletics 🏃🏽‍), did some Computer Vision and Deep Learning projects. Now, I'm founding my own health tech startup to advance patient care! 🌱

Reach out to me 📫 if you are interested in Machine Learning, Open Source, and building AI products that make the world a better place!
